(Note: For the sake of simplicity, I am using ‘Google’ to refer to ‘Alphabet’ as well.) 

### **What is Google Maps?** 

Let's first understand what Google Maps is. **Google Maps is a multifaceted entity, serving as a platform, a suite of products, and a feature-set integrated into other Google offerings**. It provides a platform for developers and businesses (such as Airbnb, Starbucks) to integrate maps and related capabilities within their sites and applications, and a platform for local businesses (such as restaurants, boutique shops, service providers) to share their business details and acquire customers through functionalities like reviews, appointment booking and more. Google Maps offers a range of products, including web and mobile maps, location search, points of interest, indoor maps, aerial photography, street view, real-time traffic conditions, satellite imagery, navigation tools and transportation options. Additionally, Google Maps is embedded in other Google products like Google Search, Google Cloud Platform, and Google Ads. Given its vast capabilities, it's overly simplistic to consider Google Maps a single product. I will strive to analyze Google Maps across its various platforms, products, and features. 

### **What is the business of Google Maps?** 

If we take a broad definition of ‘business’ which means not just the money-making part of an enterprise, but its reason for existence including the value it creates, the entities for whom it creates this value, the manner of creating this value as well as the way it manages the money to ensure it continues to be a going concern. These aspects are best covered by the [Business Model Canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas). Given below is the analysis of Google Maps using this methodology. 

**Customer Segments**  (**Strong**)    
Google Maps targets multiple customer segments successfully. 

1. Individuals seeking navigation and location-based information search \- 1 billion+ monthly active users \[[Google’s blogpost in 2020](https://blog.google/products/maps/look-back-15-years-mapping-world/)\].   
2. Developers, Businesses and Organizations requiring mapping data, mapping related services and integrating Google Maps API into their applications \- 5 million+ websites and apps supported through APIs every week \[[Google’s blogpost in 2020](https://blog.google/products/maps/look-back-15-years-mapping-world/)\].   
3. Advertisers looking for location based advertising \- Google’s metrics are unknown, however [independent research](https://porchgroupmedia.com/blog/location-based-marketing-on-the-rise/) indicates that 84% advertisers use location data in their campaigns for either targeting or analysis. All location related advertising cannot be attributed to Maps, but it definitely presents a strong connection. 

Google Maps is very strong in this area considering its global customer base that includes individuals, businesses, organizations and more. 

**Value Propositions**  (**Strong**)   
Google Maps has a strong value proposition for all of its customer segments.   

1. Individuals: Accurate up-to-date maps, Real-time traffic information, Turn-by-turn navigation, Street views, Satellite imagery, Seamless integration with other Google products such as calendar and search.   
2. Advertisers: Location-based advertising on multiple devices and across several different Google products and services as well as third party sites and apps.   
3. Local Businesses: Ability to acquire customers by sharing details such as restaurant menus, as well as connect with them through use cases such as booking appointments and replying to reviews.   
4. Developers and Businesses: API to integrate maps and information of local businesses and places; to get addresses, geo-coordinates, time-zone, elevation, images; to validate addresses; to get directions, distances, travel times; to get environment data such as air quality. 

Considering the depth of use cases across all of its target customer segments, Google Maps has a very strong value proposition among its customers. 

**Customer Relationships**  (**Okay-ish**)   
Google Maps has a similar relationship to its customers as the rest of Google products i.e., ‘you-are-on-your-own low-expense-to-google kind of relationship’. 

1. Individuals: Self-service, Community support forums and Content such as blogs, help-pages and videos. Google relies heavily on self-service and community support mechanisms for all its products and services.     
2. Businesses and Advertisers: Self-service, Sales team for enterprises. Only for large businesses that are large revenue drivers or organizations having high visibility, Google has built strong sales and business development teams. The small enterprise customers are treated similar to individuals.     
3. Developers: Self-service, Community support forums, Ticketing support for APIs. 

Google’s reliance on self-service need not be a bad thing. This strategy helps Google scale its products massively across geographies without the limitation of hiring employees to service them all. Still it does weaken the ties that customers have with its product, and it becomes an easy choice to try out other products. Hence, we can consider Google Maps to be Okay in this dimension. 

**Customer Reach Channels**  (**Okay-ish**)   
Similar to Google’s approach to managing customer relationships mentioned above, Google relies on word-of-mouth marketing and minimal focus on distribution through direct sales and business development. 

1. Direct Free/Earned: Maps website, Maps mobile apps, Self-service APIs, Integrations into other Google products e.g., calendar, search. While Google Maps relies heavily on directly reaching its customers, it is also integrated into Google’s other products and services such as Search, Calendar and others.   
2. Direct Paid: Enterprise Sales and Business Development teams. For high value entities such as enterprises and large organizations, Google also has Sales and Business development teams.   
3. Indirect: Partnership and procurement teams for device manufacturers.  In addition, Google has also built relationships with device manufacturers such as Samsung for distribution and reach of Google Maps. 

Google Maps’ approach to customer reach is also reliant on reaching customers directly as an internet product or service with minimal intermediaries \- for both, consumers and enterprise customers. Hence, this aspect could be best considered Okay. 

**Key Resources**  (**Strong**)   
While Google Maps primarily started with just a strong technology team with an idea, it has built an impressive set of resources over the years. 

1. Innovation and Scale culture: While Google Maps had a first mover advantage, it also had the willingness to continuously innovate and invest in scaling the product and its use cases.   
2. Team: Strong product development and operations teams that continue to bring new innovations to market.    
3. Data and Technology: Mapping data and satellite imagery, advanced algorithms and AI technology for data creation and management, mapping, navigation, traffic prediction, technology infrastructure to serve maps and related functionalities with minimal latencies throughout the world.   
4. Brand and customer penetration: Google Maps has build an enviable mindshare and penetration among individuals, developers and businesses. 

These resources, especially the innovation culture and the strong team, are probably the biggest reason for the success of Google Maps. This is definitely one of the strongest aspects of Google Maps and very difficult for others to copy. 

**Key Partners**  (**Strong**)   
It may not be evident, but Google Maps leverages a lot of partnerships to build and maintain Google Maps. 

1. Mapping data: Government agencies and independent businesses for worldwide mapping and satellite imagery data.    
2. Geolocation data: Internet and Telecom companies for geolocation data i.e., the location of users’ devices \[[Google Developer API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview)\].    
3. Device integration: Automotive and Mobile device manufacturers for maps integration and in-vehicle navigation.   
4. Local data on places and businesses: Individuals and local businesses for local data collection. 

These partnerships have been very important for Google Maps in ensuring large user penetration, high accuracy of maps and innovative useful features for its users, thus definitely a Strong aspect. 

**Key Activities**  (**Strong**)   
It takes a lot to build and maintain Google Maps.  

1. Data management: Collection, processing and maintenance of mapping data, information of places and businesses, navigation types and so much more.   
2. Software development and delivery: New feature development, technology infrastructure development and maintenance. This applies to all the Maps’ products for all customer types \- web/mobile apps, APIs, advertiser tools, measurement tools, others.   
3. Marketing, customer service and community management: Although self-service channels are less expensive than other distribution and servicing channels, it still takes some effort such as creating self-service content, as well as setting up and managing community forums. For some specific scenarios, Google has actual human customer service as well e.g., lost or stolen passwords. 

Google Maps definitely accomplishes all of these very effectively and leaves no stone unturned to excel at these activities, hence this aspect can be considered a Strong point for Google Maps. 

**Cost Structure**  (**Okay-ish**)   
Coming to the actual money aspect of a business, Google Maps requires a whole lot of money, both capital expenditure and recurring expenses. Google does not release product-wise cost so it is difficult to get exact numbers. 

1. Data: The cost to acquire data includes payments to partners for their data or services such as field agents who collect this data. It could also include marketing expenses to encourage businesses to submit their data themselves.   
2. Technology infrastructure: This includes the cost to build and maintain the infrastructure that serves Google Maps’ products and features to its users worldwide.    
3. Research and Development: This includes the development and maintenance of the Google Maps product.   
4. User acquisition: The cost to acquire users includes marketing as well as other expenses such as payments to device manufacturers to pre-load the apps.    
5. Miscellaneous: Other costs include operations, support teams and more. 

The capex and recurring expenses are massive and hence this aspect can be considered Okay. 

**Revenue Streams**  (**Strong? Weak?**)   
Similar to costs, it is difficult to know about revenue streams in the absence of financial disclosures from Google. Costs are somewhat understandable qualitatively, but revenue streams are even more difficult to get a grasp on. 

1. Advertising in Maps: Google Maps generates revenue directly through promoted places on Maps surfaces e.g., brand logos displayed on maps, and during navigation e.g., take a right after 7-Eleven.   
2. Advertising outside Maps: Most of the location based advertising and search advertising for local businesses could be attributed to Google Maps. A lot of this advertising comes from Google search e.g., grocery shops near me. It’s debatable whether those would exist in the absence of Google Maps, but irrespective I’m sure that the Google Maps team would be considering those to justify investments into Google Maps.   
3. API usage: With the rise in location oriented software businesses such as Uber and Instacart, the use of Google’s APIs has shot up significantly. As these companies became large, some of them have even migrated to their own maps. Relative to advertising, the Maps API fees might be a smaller contributor to Google’s revenues, but still large enough to mention. 

While it is difficult to know the reality due to lack of information from Google, a few independent estimates indicate that Google Maps might be contributing USD 5-15 billion annual revenue. That’s huge but not so much considering Google’s size. Moreover, Google might be able to get a lot of it even if Google Maps did not exist. I’m leaning towards calling this a weak-point for Google Maps, however I’m unable to do so definitively due to the lack of enough information from Google.  At some point in the future, I will try to get better estimates to develop a stronger point of view. 

### **Why did Google create Google Maps and still continues to maintain and improve it?** 

Let’s start with the company’s mission \- ‘**Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful**’.  Without doubt, Google created a huge value for its users by organizing the information related to locations & places (consider the terabytes of data that powers maps), by making it accessible in the form of easy to use consumer products (such as maps and location search) and by making it useful through innovative products (such as turn by turn directions and Waymo). Google Maps is a big step towards Google furthering its mission. 

From the perspective of a pragmatic investor, Google derives several benefits from Google Maps. 

* Short-Term Direct Benefits: Google earns revenue through [local search ads](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/local-services-ads-expands/),  [promoted places](https://blog.google/products/ads/engage-holiday-shoppers-with-promoted-places-in-google-maps/) and through the [Maps API](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/special-delivery-google-maps-apis/).   
* Short-Term Indirect Benefits: Google engages users on Google Maps and related products and in the process collects data that delivers better experience in other Google products such as Search ([explore a new location](https://blog.google/intl/en-ca/products/explore-get-answers/new-ways-to-browse-hotels-and-find-things-to-do-on-your-next-trip/), [travel trends](https://blog.google/products/search/holiday-travel-trends-insights-2024/)) and Android ([emergency services](https://blog.google/products/android/expanding-emergency-location-service-android-us/), [theft protection](https://blog.google/products/android/android-theft-protection/)), as well as better advertising across all ad surfaces ([hotel bookings targeted at travelers](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/performance-max-travel-goals/)).   
* Long-Term Direct Benefits: Google Maps helped Google enter other businesses ([Waymo](https://waymo.com/blog/2020/09/the-waymo-driver-handbook-mapping/), [Google Travel](https://travel.google/)) and helped make progress on corporate goals such as sustainability ([Sidewalk Labs](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/how-sidewalk-labs-is-helping-make-cities-more-sustainable-in-2022/), [promoting fuel efficiency](https://sustainability.google/empowering-individuals/#google-maps)).   
* Long-Term Indirect Benefits: Google Maps, along with other Google products, has created a strong lock-in for Google’s customers, both consumers and advertisers. It is very expensive and effort-intensive for consumers and advertisers to shun Google’s ecosystem in favor of other similar products. 

The short-term success metrics for Google Maps would be around the key business and customer outcomes. 

**Business**: Google does not break out the business of Google Maps in its investor filings. A few research sites estimate that as of 2023/24, Google Maps could be generating an annual revenue of USD $5-15 billion from advertising and API usage combined. Google also does not report its expenditure on Google Maps, neither capex nor running expenses. In a future post, I will try to estimate these values to generate a better picture of the overall business. Considering most of the estimates out there, it would be fair to say that Google Maps is a decent profitable business for the company. Further, the investment in Google Maps and its unparalleled global database of geographic information that includes places, businesses, roads, and even satellite imagery helps Google reduce the required investment into a few other products and services. 

**Customer**: Google Maps has 1 billion+ monthly active users \[[Google’s blogpost in 2020](https://blog.google/products/maps/look-back-15-years-mapping-world/)\] and supports 5 million+ websites and apps every week through APIs \[[Google’s blogpost in 2020](https://blog.google/products/maps/look-back-15-years-mapping-world/)\] in 250+ countries and territories \[[Google Maps coverage details as of 2024](https://developers.google.com/maps/coverage)\] and 74 languages \[[Google Maps on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps)\]. The Google Maps app has 4.7 stars from 6M+ ratings on Apple App Store and 3.9 stars from 18M+ ratings on Google Play Store. Not much data is available on the satisfaction and scale of advertisers and developers. Considering Google’s reputation for killing unsuccessful products and investing continuously in successful ones, we can estimate that Google is getting a very good traction on location oriented advertising and Maps APIs with advertisers and developers. 

In addition, there are several soft benefits that are difficult to perceive at first glance. Google Maps enhances Google’s connection with its user base, its reputation for innovation, and its ability to work towards its sustainability goals. All of these contribute towards building a strong positive brand for Google. 

### **What are the key strengths of Google Maps?**  

1. Data & Technology: Google possesses a robust technology infrastructure to collect data (such as Street View cars, Street View Trekker, local community engagement), process & store data (satellite images, traffic), derive inferences (patterns of buildings derived through machine learning) and create innovative user experiences (street view, navigation, address search, and more) for end users.   
2. Network Effects: Google Maps benefits from strong network effects, engaging a large user base (individuals and businesses) and collecting vast amounts of data (such as data on traffic and local businesses) which further enhances the product’s value (through real time traffic congestion detection, business reviews, appointment scheduling) and attracts even more users.   
3. Team and Culture: The team and the culture are probably the most underestimated aspect of any company or product. The strengths such as data, technology, continuous innovation and network effects are downstream from the team and culture. Due to the presence of a strong team and due to Google’s culture of innovation and scale, Google Maps has developed its other strengths and continues to be a strong product. 

### **In which places is Google Maps particularly weak?**  

1. Privacy concerns: Google Maps' extensive data collection and tracking raise concerns among users and businesses, potentially impacting adoption and trust.  
2. Enterprise use cases: As a product primarily designed for individual users, Google Maps may not fully address businesses focused use cases such as logistics management, advanced route planning and real-time field force tracking, thus limiting its appeal to enterprise customers.  

While the customer relationships and support could be considered weak, they are mostly intentional and probably an essential trade-off to achieve scale, hence I do not consider them as a weak point. 

### **What are the opportunities in front of Google Maps?**  

1. Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) Experiences: Leveraging its technological strengths, Google can develop AR and VR experiences on the foundation of maps. These could include entertainment (such as AR gaming in the real world or VR gaming experiences derived from real world), navigation (within AR glasses or in vehicles’ heads-up displays), and more. This would create value for customers and create higher customer loyalty (lock-in).   
2. Revenue opportunity with enterprises: Google can expand its cloud division's focus on enterprise customers by developing more comprehensive business-oriented solutions, such as advanced logistics, route planning, field force tracking and more. 

### **Against what threats does Google Maps need to guard itself?**  

1. Potential for misuse and manipulation: Google must continue to vigilantly protect against data misuse by individuals, businesses, or employees, ensuring the integrity of its vast data collection.   
2. Emerging alternatives: Competitors like Apple Maps, Open Maps, and several others have emerged, challenging Google's dominance in the mapping industry. Entities like Uber have invested in their own maps to avoid paying for Google Maps API.    
3. Potential Regulation: Google Maps' extensive data collection and integration into users' lives may attract regulatory scrutiny, potentially limiting data collection or usage. 

### **What are the potential next steps for Google Maps?** 

If I had to plan the future of Google Maps, I would focus on these broad buckets of initiatives. 

**Sustaining Innovation and Market Leadership**: Google Maps' success is rooted in its pioneering spirit, introducing a robust product that innovated on multiple fronts, and continuing to improve it over the years. To maintain its market position, Google Maps must expand its offerings, addressing new use cases and customer segments else emerging competitors may try to benefit from Google's innovations and mistakes, posing a threat to its dominance. Google Maps must persist in its pace of innovation to maintain its lead over its competitors. 

**Unlocking Enterprise Potential**: Google Maps has a significant untapped opportunity in the enterprise sector. By leveraging its core strengths, including Google Maps, Google Cloud Platform, Google Devices, and Services, the company can develop comprehensive solutions for advanced logistics, routing, vehicle and personnel tracking, and related applications. This strategic focus can help Google Maps tap into the enterprise market, driving growth and diversification.
