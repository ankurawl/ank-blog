**About the author** 

I, Ankur, have worked in the technology industry for two about decades, most recently at Amazon and Meta, as a product manager. During my career, I also had the good fortune to work in a few different geographies (Asia/India, North America/USA, Europe/Switzerland). I have worked on a diverse set of products such as B2C/C2C ecommerce, subscriptions economy and B2B inventory financing. For a long time, I have tried thinking about products from the lens of the company - Why did this company build this product? Why is the company optimizing for X instead of Y? Why doesn’t the company simply do Z? Recently, I decided to publish these analyses somewhere. Hence the idea of this site was born. 

**Purpose of this site: Analysis of technology products from the company’s perspective** 

This website is dedicated to publishing in-depth product analysis of technology products, sharing their strengths and weaknesses. Through the eyes of a product and business analyst, I will evaluate products across various dimensions including business strategy, customer needs, technological capabilities, industry trends, competitive landscapes, and partnership opportunities. Whenever possible, I will use standard industry frameworks to organize my analysis, making it easy to follow and comprehensive in scope. By taking a holistic approach, I aim to provide valuable insights that will inform and educate readers, in the process helping them better understand the products and technologies that matter to them.
